# BdatEditor-Python
Bdat Editor Python Rewrite

Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
PySimpleGUIQt

setup script for these will come later since I'm bad

this program currently only works for XC2

It's also extremely use at your own risk right now

CAVEATS:

- New rows *must* be filled completely right now. If they are not the bdat writer will throw an error.


CHANGELOG:
06/04/2021: Added full undo and redo features
